#### Machine learning in healthcare for disease progression modeling
Learn about diseases using clinical trial data, and unsupervised learning of clinical biomarkers. Address the challenges with data in healthcare being non-linear, or missing, or having complex variation due to treatment protocols, and in cases of rare diseases having a  small number of samples to learn from. Statistical models are used for sequential data with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and [Gaussian] state space models (SSM).  Domain knowledge (like for cancer progression lines of therapy and mechanism drug effect) is incorporated to design deep generative models (neural networks architecture) for clinical trials. Traditional PK-PD models to model dynamics of a single biomarker due to a single drug. Neural network architecture applied to model the effect of multiple simultaneous interventions on latent representations, with the end goal to improve model's ability to generalize and forecast clinical biomarkers. 

#### Use cases similar to develop clinical decision support tools 
Understand the needs of oncologists when treating patients and what forecasting tasks might be of interest  From predictive to counterfactual models use a starting point for model-based reinforcement learning. 
High level knowledge in research opportunities to enhance multi-model decision making oncology in forecasting patient data, predicting time to progression, and likelihood of successful treatment. 

#### [Medical imaging] Challenge to predict FVC decline based on high-res CT scan. 
Predict relative or absolute FVC decline given CT(1) and FVC(t1). Perform initial data, sanity check and performance of baseline algorithms. 
FEV1 and FVC: The FEV1/FVC ratio, also called Tiffeneau-Pinelli index,[1] is a calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease.[2][3] It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC).[4] The result of this ratio is expressed as FEV1%.
The evaluation metric is a modified version of Laplace Log Likelihood. In medical applications, it is useful to evaluate a model's confidence in its decisions. Accordingly, the metric is designed to reflect both the accuracy and certainty of each prediction. For each true FVC measurement, we predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation σ).
